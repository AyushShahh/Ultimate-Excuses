## Demonstration ‚ú®

## Brief
With a lot of excuses, this site can help you if you get stuck in some situations. Keep pressing the button until you get the excuse you want.<br>
After that, copy the excuse by pressing the copy button.<br>
It is as simple as that.

## Web App
 While you can go to the browser everytime for using the [website](https://ultimatexcuses.netlify.app), I would suggest you to use the **web app** so that you don't have to go to the browser and type in the website everytime. You can directly open the **web application** on your **home screen** or the **desktop shortcut** on your computer to use the website.<br>

 **Follow the steps:**
1. For desktop users
- Chrome
    - Open the [website](https://ultimatexcuses.netlify.app)
    - Tap the **three dots &#8942;** on the top right corner
    - Click on **More tools**
    - Click on **Create shortcut**
    - Check **Open as window** option and click create
2. For mobile users
- Chrome
    - Navigate to the [website](https://ultimatexcuses.netlify.app)
    - Tap the **three dots &#8942;** on the top right corner
    - Scroll down and click on **Add to home screen**
    - Click **Add**
- Safari
    - Navigate to the [website](https://ultimatexcuses.netlify.app)
    - Click on **Share icon** at bottom<br> 
    (On the iPad, share icon is located at the **top-right**)
    - Tap **Add to home screen** from the menu
    - Type name for shortcut and then tap **Add** button

Now you can use this site as a **Web App**.<br>
The process might be similar for other browsers too.
